# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog is automatically generated by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) based on [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/).

## Migration to Semantic Versioning

Starting from this release, this project adopts [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) for all releases. The previous date-based tagging system has been replaced with automated SemVer releases based on conventional commits.

## How to trigger releases

This project uses conventional commits to automatically determine the next version:

- `feat:` - New features (minor version bump)
- `fix:` - Bug fixes (patch version bump)
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` or `!` - Breaking changes (major version bump)
- `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:` - No version bump

## Previous releases

All releases prior to the SemVer migration used date-based tags (e.g., `v19082025-5117d489`).
